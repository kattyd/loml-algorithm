# loml-algorithm
Picks two random people from two sets, male and female (sorry my queer friends, will work on this more so it works for everyone), and calculates the percentage match between them.

# objective
I created this for a blind dating show that is going to be filmed at my school. We wanted to pick two random people from those who registered and figured it would be more fun using code and suddenly we thought up figuring out how much each of the 'daters' matched.
The traits used in this are just for a sample so the percentages will not vary alot. But when the answers to the real questions are entered in real life there should be a wider range of percentages gotten.

# the premise of the show
The show shows viewers what % match there was between the two selected and the purpose is to see if the computer generated match (be it high or low) affects the date in real life.

This is not a very good README but I hope it has done a good job of encapsulating what this program is and what it does.
Cheers!

** This is also my first python program. I have used the language before but this is the first time i have completed a full project with it. **
